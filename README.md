## Blog Template built with Sanity

# DEAR JUNA Sanity Blog
Dear Juna is a blog I created for my wife so that we could give totally unqualified advice to our child. The Blog is simple, featuring a carousel, about me blurb, a featured post section, and post tiles at the bottom. It is connected to Sanity CMS and will be deployed using vercel.

## DEMO: ##
Visit home page, hover over tiles, view a post, post a comment:
